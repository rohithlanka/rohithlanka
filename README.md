### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rohith Lanka, and I'm currently on an exciting journey learning new tools in Data Engineering! I've decided to transition my focus to building data pipelines specifically end-to-end pipelines where people can get instant insghts.

ðŸŒ± **I'm currently learning:**
-  Advanced Data Pipeline Orchestration with Apache Airflow
-  Modern Data Modeling and Transformation with DBT
-  Cloud Data Engineering on AWS (Preparing for certifications)

ðŸ”­ **I'm currently working on:**
-  A basic data-pipeline which fetches data from API and does the transformation in snowflake using DBT and transformed data in migrated to tableau and the entire job is orechestrated using airflow which is running on docker.

ðŸ‘¯ **I'm looking to collaborate on:**
-  Open-source Data Engineering projects focusing on optimizing pipeline efficiency and scalability
-  Collaborative efforts to solve complex data challenges and deliver actionable insights

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:**
- My learning experience with Data-engineering
- Overcoming common obstacles encountered in Data Engineering projects
